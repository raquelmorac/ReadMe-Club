I want to create a page for a readers club that helps us to manage our reads.
* Clubs members managements
* Manage books:
    * Book we are currently reading
    * Lists of "Want to read" where we can add, delete... books
    * List of Read books
    * List of recommended books based on our lists and ratings.
    * When a new book is added, look for further info in the internet
* Manage the club's weekly sessions:
    * When the session will happen
    * Which book we are reading 
    * Pages to read for the next session
    * AI suggestions about the number of sessions and pages to read for a given book 
* For read books it should be possible that each club member rates it from 1 to 5, along with an optional comment.
